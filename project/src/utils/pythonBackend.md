# Python Backend Implementation Notes

In a full implementation, the client-side JavaScript would communicate with a Python backend that handles the heavy lifting of resume analysis. Here's how the Python backend would be structured:

## Python Backend Architecture

```
/server
  /app.py           # FastAPI or Flask entry point
  /analyzer
    /__init__.py
    /parser.py      # Resume parsing and text extraction
    /nlp.py         # NLP analysis (keyword extraction, entity recognition)
    /scorer.py      # Resume scoring algorithms
    /matcher.py     # Job description matching logic
  /models
    /__init__.py
    /resume.py      # Resume data models
    /analysis.py    # Analysis result models
  /utils
    /__init__.py
    /text.py        # Text processing utilities
    /files.py       # File handling utilities
```

## Key Python Libraries

1. **Document Parsing**:
   - PyPDF2 or pdfminer.six for PDF parsing
   - python-docx for DOCX files
   - textract for handling multiple file formats

2. **NLP and Text Analysis**:
   - NLTK for basic NLP tasks
   - spaCy for named entity recognition and advanced NLP
   - sklearn for text vectorization and similarity analysis
   - sentence-transformers for semantic similarity

3. **Web Framework**:
   - FastAPI for high-performance API with automatic documentation
   - Flask as a lightweight alternative

4. **Data Handling**:
   - pandas for data manipulation
   - pydantic for data validation

## Core Python Functions

### Resume Parsing

```python
def extract_text_from_resume(file_path):
    """Extract text content from resume files of various formats."""
    # Implementation would detect file type and use appropriate library
    # Return plain text content from the resume

def parse_resume_sections(text):
    """Parse resume text into structured sections."""
    # Use regex patterns and NLP techniques to identify sections
    # Return a dictionary with section names and their content
```

### NLP Analysis

```python
def extract_keywords(text, custom_keywords=None):
    """Extract important keywords from text."""
    # Use TF-IDF or other keyword extraction techniques
    # Return a list of keywords with their importance scores

def analyze_sentence_structure(text):
    """Analyze sentence structure and composition."""
    # Check for action verbs, passive voice, etc.
    # Return analysis of sentence quality

def check_grammar_spelling(text):
    """Check for grammar and spelling issues."""
    # Use language checking libraries
    # Return list of potential issues
```

### Job Matching

```python
def match_resume_to_job(resume_text, job_description):
    """Compare resume content to job description for compatibility."""
    # Extract keywords from both documents
    # Calculate similarity scores
    # Identify missing keywords
    # Return match analysis
```

### Scoring Algorithm

```python
def score_resume(parsed_resume, analysis_results):
    """Generate scores for different aspects of the resume."""
    # Consider factors like:
    # - Keyword density
    # - Action verb usage
    # - Quantified achievements
    # - Education relevance
    # - Skills match
    # Return scores for each section and overall
```

## API Endpoints

```python
# Using FastAPI
from fastapi import FastAPI, UploadFile, File
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class JobDescription(BaseModel):
    text: str

@app.post("/analyze")
async def analyze_resume(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    # Process the uploaded resume
    # Return analysis results

@app.post("/match")
async def match_to_job(job_desc: JobDescription, resume_id: str):
    # Match previously uploaded resume to job description
    # Return match results
```

## Integration with the Frontend

The JavaScript frontend would call these API endpoints and display the results in the UI. The communication would be through standard REST API calls or WebSockets for real-time updates during processing.
